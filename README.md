# Interpolation_function  
Using interpolation polynomials (*), we calculate the value of the function f* (x) at the point x* ∈ [a,b] with the accuracy of the sum.  
  
Interpolation of Functions - is a method of analysis and calculation of function values between known points (or values)  
based on an interpolation polynomial or other mathematical apparatus.   
The primary goal of interpolation is to approximate the values of a function at intermediate points that lie   
between known points (e.g., in the intervals between time measurements in data measurements).  
  
Using interpolation polynomials (*), we calculate the value of the function f* (x) at the point x* ∈ [a, b] with a precision of the sum.  
The program outputs:  
- the number of terms in the interpolation formula,  
- the order of finite differences,  
- the error D = | f (x*) - f* (x*) |  
- graphs of the function and two interpolation polynomials.
